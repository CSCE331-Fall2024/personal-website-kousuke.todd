                <h2>Analog Circuits</h2>
                <p>
                    I have previously taken ECEN 214, Introduction to Circuit Theory.
                    I learned about various topics, such as voltage and current dividers,
                    operational amplifiers, circuit configurations, and analysis techniques.
                    Later in to the semester, we learned about alternating current current and how
                    it applies to second order circuits. Now, I am taking ECEN 325, Electronics.
                    In this class, I have learned frequency analysis on low-pass and high-pass filters.
                    I am currently learning about more in-depth analysis techniques for operational amplifiers.

                <h2>Digital Circuits</h2>
                <p>
                    Having excelled in ECEN 248 (Intro to Digital System Design) and currently taking ECEN 449
                    (Microprocessor System Design),
                    I have experience with writing and synthesizing digital hardware. My main project was a traffic
                    light controller. The traffic light controller was essentially a state machine which cycled through
                    lights
                    with different times that each color stays on. It was also responsive to signals that indicated no
                    cars
                    on a road, changing
                    the cycle accordingly. This was implemented using Verilog, and synthesized on an FPGA Board.

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    The programming languages that I am most familiar with are C++ and Python. In my projects page, I
                    built
                    an app that used the Flutter
                    framework which uses the Dart programming language. Through building this portfolio, I have gained
                    experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    Through C++, I have implemented many data structures and algorithms. I also used it to perform
                    system
                    calls to spawn and run processes, threads, and
                    network connections.

                <h2>Computer Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    My final project in my Computer Architecture class was building a CPU. The CPU featured an
                    instruction
                    fetcher, register file, ALU, data memory, and program counter logic.
                    These components were all chained together and controlled using a controller module. We created a
                    test
                    bench that had the CPU read multiple 64-bit instructions stored in 16 hex digit formats. I used
                    Verilog
                    to synthesize the hardware and create test benches.

                <h2>Verilog</h2>
                <p>
                    As a computer engineer, Verilog is the tool that I use the most for creating hardware. Using
                    behavioral
                    Verilog, which is very similar to programming, it can create large scale hardware that you do not
                    need
                    to design yourself. Synthesizers will take behavioral Verilog, and create a digital circuit from it.
                    This makes designing hardware efficient, due to not having to design the smaller building blocks of
                    your
                    design. Using Verilog, I have created a traffic light controller and CPU.

                <h2>Speaking</h2>
                <p>
                    For the past two years as Culture Officer of Japanese Cultural Association, I have created weekly
                    presentations, and presented them to an audience of over 30 people. Through this, I have developed a
                    strong foundation in public speaking.

            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>My main interest in Computer Science lies in computer systems. As a computer engineer, I like to be
                closer to
                hardware. Through the use of system calls, I really enjoy being able to have more direct control over
                the
                hardware of a computer.</p>
