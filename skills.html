            <h1>Analog Circuits</h1>
            <p>
                I have previously taken ECEN 214, Introduction to Circuit Theory.
                I learned about various topics, such as voltage and current dividers,
                operational amplifiers, circuit configurations, and analysis techniques.
                Later in to the semester, we learned about alternating current current and how
                it applies to second order circuits. Now, I am taking ECEN 325, Electronics.
                In this class, I have learned frequency analysis on low-pass and high-pass filters.
                I am currently learning about more in-depth analysis techniques for operational amplifiers.

            <h1>Digital Circuits</h1>
            <p>
                Having excelled in ECEN 248 (Intro to Digital System Design) and currently taking ECEN 449
                (Microprocessor System Design),
                I have experience with writing and synthesizing digital hardware. My main project was a traffic
                light controller. The traffic light controller was essentially a state machine which cycled through
                lights
                with different times that each color stays on. It was also responsive to signals that indicated no cars
                on a road, changing
                the cycle accordingly. This was implemented using Verilog, and synthesized on an FPGA Board.

            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p>
                The programming languages that I am most familiar with are C++ and Python. In my projects page, I built
                an app that used the Flutter
                framework which uses the Dart programming language. Through building this portfolio, I have gained
                experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Through C++, I have implemented many data structures and algorithms. I also used it to perform system
                calls to spawn and run processes, threads, and
                network connections.

            <h1>Computer Architecture</h1>
            <p>
                My final project in my Computer Architecture class was building a CPU. The CPU featured an instruction
                fetcher, register file, ALU, data memory, and program counter logic.
                These components were all chained together and controlled using a controller module. We created a test
                bench that had the CPU read multiple 64-bit instructions stored in 16 hex digit formats. I used Verilog
                to synthesize the hardware and create test benches.

            <h1>Verilog</h1>
            <p>
                As a computer engineer, Verilog is the tool that I use the most for creating hardware. Using behavioral
                Verilog, which is very similar to programming, it can create large scale hardware that you do not need
                to design yourself. Synthesizers will take behavioral Verilog, and create a digital circuit from it.
                This makes designing hardware efficient, due to not having to design the smaller building blocks of your
                design. Using Verilog, I have created a traffic light controller and CPU.

            <h1>Speaking</h1>
            <p>
                For the past two years as Culture Officer of Japanese Cultural Association, I have created weekly
                presentations, and presented them to an audience of over 30 people. Through this, I have developed a
                strong foundation in public speaking.
